= QML Panorama viewer =

This is an implementation of a spherical viewer
for equirectangular pictures, also known as Photo Spheres,
or 360 pictures, in form of a QML element.
It can also display cube maps.

The element is implemented as a subclass of
QQuickFramebufferObject, and therefore the rendering is performed
entirely offscreen.
It is OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible, so it's supposed to run on all
platforms supported by Qt.

The support for equirectangular images and cube maps is implemented
in both cases by using a textured proxy geometry, in the first case
using a sphere and in the second case using a cube, quite like common
skyboxes.

See app for how to use the element in a working example
